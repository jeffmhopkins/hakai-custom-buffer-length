Manual custom buffersize enabler for MPC/FORCE by Amit Talwar
**************************************************************** 
you can set Period/Buffer size to one of the following: 64,96,128
It is not recommended to use 64 as the cpu load might cause audio glitches.
Force internal buffersize will be set to the value x 4 instead of default multiplier of 2.

find the script file that launches your MPC executable. its different for each Modded Firmware
add this line to that script before  MPC is called:

LD_PRELOAD=full-path-to-customBufferSizeMPC.so

basically you need to enter complete path of the included customBufferSizeMPC.so file.
you can copy this entire folder to you ssd or sd card.. and cd to the directory an do a echo $PWD to print complete path.

if you script already has some LD_PRELOAD, you can add this to the same line at  the start separated by a space.

	next you run the included script from the terminal : customBufferSizer

./customBufferSizer or fullPathTo customBufferSizer

it takes one of the following ARGUMENTS
ENABLE  (will prompt you to choose buffer size)
DISABLE (disabled custom buffer size)



i just checked and for hakai, you'd need to edit the /usr/bin/az01-launch-MPC file and edit the ld prepaid line based on the instructions..







export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/fullforce.so"
