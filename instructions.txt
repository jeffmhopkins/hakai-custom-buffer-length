Manual custom buffersize enabler for MPC/FORCE - Originally by Amit Talwar
********************************************************************************
The MPC One needs the Hakai firmware installed, after which a cusom middleware is installed to for the ALSA audio driver calls.

Period/Buffer size to one of the following: 64,96,128

It is not recommended to use 64 as the cpu load might cause audio glitches. 128 seems to have fixed all pops and crackles in my ES-9.

Instructions:
	1. Install the Hakai Firmware
	2. Copy the custombuffer files to the SD card (from your computer)
		2.1. customBufferSizeMPC.so
		2.2. customBufferSizer.sh
	3. Open putty terminal to your MPC, login as root (My MPC One I used the ethernet connection to get a direct connection to my laptop)
	4. Mount the filesystem as writeable
		4.1. mount -o rw,remount,rw /
	5. Copy the files to the internal drive
		5.1. cp /media/SDCARDNAME/customBufferSizeMPC.so /media/az01-internal/customBufferSizeMPC.so
		5.2. cp /media/SDCARDNAME/customBufferSizer.sh /media/az01-internal/customBufferSizer.sh
	6. Make the shell script executable
		6.1. chmod +x /media/az01-internal/customBufferSizer.sh
	7. Modify the LD_PRELOAD
		7.1. vi /usr/bin/az01-internal-launch-MPC
		7.2. scroll down until you see the line with LD_PRELOAD= line, and press 'i' for insert mode, until it reads:
			LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/fullforce.so /media/az01-internal/customBufferSizeMPC.so"
		7.3. press the escape key, and then ':wq' to save and quit
	7. Execute the shell script to set the buffersize
		7.1. /media/az01-internal/customBufferSizer.sh ENABLE
		7.2. after selecting your buffer size, the MPC will restart
